      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s do this I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of websites over the years, ranging from more or less official business endeavours like a small record label to more private things like a website for my wedding a while ago. I&amp;rsquo;ve never had a website just for me though, so this is something new.
Also, I&amp;rsquo;ve never been involved much with giving back to the crowd - meaning all the people posting content like reviews or code snippets online.</description>

      <description>About Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Tom and I work as a senior consultant for a small Austrian software development company.
We focus on corporate process management and IT documentation based on Microsoft products in conjunction with our own ISV-solutions. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of customization options in our tools so I&amp;rsquo;ve got to deal with anything from HTML, CSS and JS to SVG, XSL and VBA on a day to day basis.</description>
