Defining a color, a breakpoint or even a font-family globally, makes changes easier and almost completely eliminates the copy/paste and the find/replace cycle when it comes to updates in your CSS.
Now, having to support Internet Explorer 11 and below with your CSS makes this a little less exciting, as it simply doesn&amp;rsquo;t support CSS variables at all.</description></item><item><title>Responsive Web Design Certification</title><link>https://ttntm.github.io/post/fcc-certification/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ttntm.github.io/post/fcc-certification/</guid><description>freeCodeCamp I came across freeCodeCamp&amp;nbsp; a while ago, bookmarked it and forgot about it again. Going through my bookmarks some weeks ago, I re-discovered it and actually had a look at what they&amp;rsquo;re doing this time. As it turned out, they&amp;rsquo;ve got a huge collection of thousands of coding lessons including certifications that they&amp;rsquo;re offering for free based on donations.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t hesitate (this time) and started getting into their first course for the so called Responsive Web Design Certification.</description></item><item><title>Random Content from Data in Hugo</title><link>https://ttntm.github.io/post/hugo-random-content-from-data/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ttntm.github.io/post/hugo-random-content-from-data/</guid><description>Data in Hugo Hugo comes with the possibility of storing structured content in a data file where it can be pulled from by the template placing it on the site. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this used for things like pricing tables for example. There&amp;rsquo;s quite a bunch of use cases for random content on a website though, from customer references on a company website to quotes of the day for a literary blog.</description></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>https://ttntm.github.io/post/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ttntm.github.io/post/hello-world/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s do this I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of websites over the years, ranging from more or less official business endeavours like a small record label to more private things like a website for my wedding a while ago. I&amp;rsquo;ve never had a website just for me though, so this is something new.
Also, I&amp;rsquo;ve never been involved much with giving back to the crowd - meaning all the people posting content like reviews or code snippets online.</description></item></channel></rss>
