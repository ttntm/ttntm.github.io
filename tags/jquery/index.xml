She wanted to get rid of some sort of hosted service, moving to her own website.
Showcasing her work was clearly the focus of the site, so it also needed to provide some decent filtering of the portfolio items.
The site itself was supposed to be built with Hugo that already provides a ton of functionality in terms of taxonomy and content metadata.</description></item></channel></rss>
