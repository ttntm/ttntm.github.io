Showcasing her work was clearly the focus of the site, so it also needed to provide some decent filtering of the portfolio items.
The site itself was supposed to be built with Hugo that already provides a ton of functionality in terms of taxonomy and content metadata.</description></item><item><title>Using CSS Variables in Internet Explorer</title><link>https://ttntm.github.io/blog/using-css-variables-internet-explorer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ttntm.github.io/blog/using-css-variables-internet-explorer/</guid><description>Using CSS variables CSS variables (see: w3schools.com&amp;nbsp;) make working with stylesheets easier, no doubt about that.
