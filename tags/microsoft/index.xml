I recently had to work on some infographics and marketing imagery for a pretty complex piece of software.
Googling up stuff like industry 4.0 or software development lifecycle infographics lead to a bunch of different &amp;ldquo;buy your image&amp;rdquo; kind of sites, going through them didn&amp;rsquo;t yield anything suitable though.
What made the whole procedure even more complicated, was the need for an SVG image. That requirement lead to the idea of doing the whole thing in Visio eventually, which is capable of producing SVGs from drawings natively.</description></item></channel></rss>
